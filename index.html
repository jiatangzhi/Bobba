          Bubble tea, pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, tapioca milk tea, boba
          tea, or boba</span
        >
        is a tea-based drink accompanied by chewy
        <span>tapioca balls("boba" or "pearls"), </span> but it can be made with
        other toppings as well, such as
        <span>grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, or popping boba</span>. It has
        many varieties and flavors, but the two most popular varieties are pearl
        black milk tea and pearl green milk tea ("pearl" signifies the tapioca
        balls at the bottom). It is possible to adjust the level of sugar and
        ice. Enjoy!
